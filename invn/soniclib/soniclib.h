 *
 * \brief SonicLib public API and support functions for TDK/InvenSense ultrasonic
 * sensors (originally developed by Chirp Microsystems).
 *
 * SonicLib is a set of API functions and sensor driver routines designed to easily
 * control ultrasonic sensors from an embedded C application.  It allows an
 * application developer to obtain ultrasonic measurement data from one or more devices,
 * without needing to develop special low-level code to interact with the sensors directly.
 *
 * The SonicLib API functions provide a consistent interface for an application to use
 * ultrasonic sensors in various situations.  This is especially important, because
 * all TDK/InvenSense ultrasonic sensors are completely programmable, including the memory
 * map.  The SonicLib interfaces allow an application to use different sensor firmware images,
 * without requiring code changes.  Only a single initialization parameter must be modified
 * to use the new sensor firmware.
 *
 * SonicLib is used with all TDK/InvenSense ultrasonic sensors and firmware types and contains
 * all necessary functions to initialize and manage the devices.  It includes a complete set
 * of interfaces for typical rangefinding applications that measure distance using the
 * sensor(s).  Certain special sensor firmware may support unusual features, and additional
 * API interfaces for those special functions may be distributed separately.
 *
 * All function names in the SonicLib API begin with `ch_`.
 *
 * \note All operation of the sensor is controlled through the set of functions, data structures,
 * and symbolic values defined in this header file.  You should not need to modify this file
 * or the SonicLib functions, or use lower-level internal functions such as described in
 * the ch_driver.h file or other files in the `details` subdirectory.  Using any of these internal
 * definitions will reduce your ability to benefit from future enhancements and releases
 * from TDK/InvenSense.
 *
 *
 * #### Board Support Package
 * SonicLib also defines a set of board support package (BSP) functions that must be
 * provided by the developer, board vendor, or TDK/InvenSense.  The BSP functions are
 * NOT part of SonicLib - they are external interface routines that allow the SonicLib
 * functions to access the peripherals on the target board.  These functions, which all
 * begin with a "chbsp_" prefix, are described in the chirp_bsp.h header file.  See the
 * descriptions in that file for more detailed information on the BSP interfaces.
 *
 * Additionally, SonicLib requires the definition of a few static configuration
 * symbols. These are generally board dependent and are used to set the size of
 * static arrays, choose between hardware features that are unlikely to ever
 * change at runtime, etc.
 *
 * There are two ways to provide these symbols. The default behavior expects
 * a header called chirp_board_config.h to be directly on the include path.
 * A default implementation of this file is provided with the BSP, or can be
 * copied from <invn/soniclib/details/chirp_board_config.h>. Once copied and
 * placed in your project, you can edit it to meet your needs. Make sure that
 * your build places the directory containing chirp_board_config.h on the
 * include path (gcc -I option).
 *
 * The second method for providing the symbols is to use the build system
 * define flags. For example, you can use the -D option with gcc. To use this
 * method, you must first define the symbol INVN_SONICLIB_INTERNAL_BOARD_CONFIG.
 * This will cause soniclib to use the board config in <invn/soniclib/details>.
 * You should not edit this file directly. Instead, to change the value of the
 * symbols defined there, simply override them with -D flags during the build.
 *
 *
 * #### Basic Operating Sequence
 * At a high level, an application using SonicLib will do the following:
 *  -# Initialize the hardware on the board
 *  -# Initialize the Soniclib group structures, by calling \a ch_group_init()
 *  -# Initialize the SonicLib devices structures, by calling \a ch_init() for each sensor.
 *  -# Program and start the sensor(s), by calling \a ch_group_start().
 *  -# Set up a handler function to process interrupts from the sensor.
 *  -# Set up a triggering mechanism using a board timer, (unless the sensor will be used
 *  in free-running mode, in which no external trigger is needed).  A
 *  timer handler routine will typically trigger the sensor(s) using \a ch_group_trigger().
 *  -# Configure the sensor's operating range, detection thresholds, and other parameters.
 *  -# Set the sensor mode to enable sensing.
 *
 *  There are dedicated `ch_set_xxx()` functions for all configuration values.  Simple
 *  configurations may be able to use the \a ch_set_config() convenience function to
 *  configure the sensor and set the mode.
 *
 * At this point, the sensor will begin to perform measurements.  At the end of each
 * measurement cycle, the sensor will interrupt the host controller using its INT line.
 * The handler routine set up in step #4 above will be called, and it should cause the
 * application to read the measurement results from the sensor(s), using \a ch_get_range()
 * and optionally \a ch_get_amplitude() and/or \a ch_get_iq_data().
 *
 * Do not trigger a new measurement until the previous measurement has completed and all needed
 * data has been read from the device (including I/Q data, if \a ch_get_iq_data() is used).  If any
 * I/O operations are still active, the new measurement may be corrupted.
 *
 * #### Verbose Debug Output
 * To assist with debugging, verbose debug output from various internal SonicLib functions
 * may be enabled by defining `CH_LOG_MODULE_LEVEL=X` during the system build.

 *
 * This function is used to initialize various Chirp SonicLib structures before using a sensor.
 * The ch_dev_t device descriptor is the primary data structure used to manage a sensor, and its
 * address will subsequently be used as a handle to identify the sensor when calling most API functions.
 *
 * The \a dev_ptr parameter is the address of the ch_dev_t descriptor structure that will be initialized
 * and then used to identify and manage this sensor. The \a grp_ptr parameter is the address of a
 * ch_group_t structure describing the sensor group that will include the new sensor.  Both the ch_dev_t
 * structure and the ch_group_t structure must have already been allocated before this function is called.
 *
 * A separate ch_dev_t structure must be allocated for each sensor.
 *
 * \a dev_num is a simple index value that uniquely identifies a sensor within a group.  Each possible
 * sensor (i.e. each physical port on the board that could have a Chirp sensor attached) has a number,
 * starting with zero (0).  The device number is constant - it remains associated with a specific port
 * even if no sensor is actually attached.  Often, the \a dev_num value is used by both the
 * application and the board support package as an index into arrays containing per-sensor
 * information (e.g. data read from the sensors, pin assignments, etc.).
 *
 * The Chirp sensor is fully re-programmable, and the specific features and capabilities can be modified
 * by using different sensor firmware images.  The \a fw_init_func parameter is the address (name) of
 * the sensor firmware initialization routine that should be used to program the sensor and prepare it
 * for operation. The selection of this routine name is the only required change when switching from
 * one sensor firmware image to another.

 *
 * This function reads the raw I/Q measurement data from the sensor.  The I/Q data set includes
 * a discrete pair of values for each of the samples that make up a full measurement cycle.   Each
 * individual sample is reported as a pair of values, I and Q, in a quadrature format.  The I/Q
 * values may be used to calculate the relative amplitude of the measured ultrasound signal.
 *
 * The contents of the I/Q trace are updated on every measurement cycle, even if no target was
 * detected (i.e. even if \a ch_get_range() returns \a CH_NO_TARGET).  (Note that this is different
 * than the regular amplitude value, as returned by \a ch_get_amplitude(), which is \a not updated
 * unless a target is detected.)
 *
 * Each sample I/Q pair consists of two signed 16-bit integers and is described by the
 * \a ch_iq_sample_t structure. To convert any given pair of I/Q values to the amplitude value for
 * that sample, square both I and Q, and take the square root of the sum:
 * 			\f[Amp_n = \sqrt{(I_n)^2 + (Q_n)^2}\f]
 * Amplitude values in the sensor are expressed only in internal ADC counts (least-significant bits,
 * or LSBs) and are not calibrated to any standard units.
 *
 * The number of samples used in each I/Q trace is determined by the maximum range setting for the
 * device.  If it is set to less than the maximum possible range, not all samples will contain valid
 * data.  To determine the number of active samples within the trace, use \a ch_get_num_samples().
 *
 *  - To read all valid I/Q data, set \a start_sample to zero (0), and set \a num_samples to the

 *
 * To allow more flexibility in your application, the I/Q data readout from the device may be done

 * mode, the I/O operation takes place using DMA access in the background.  This function will
 * return immediately, and a notification will later be issued when the I/Q has been read.  To
 * use the \a non_block option, the board support package (BSP) you are using must provide the
 * \a chbsp_i2c_read_nb() and \a chbsp_i2c_read_mem_nb() functions.  To use non-blocking reads
 * of the I/Q data, you must specify a callback routine that will be called when the I/Q read
 * completes.  See \a ch_io_complete_callback_set().
 *
 * Non-blocking reads are managed together for a group of sensors.  To perform a non-blocking read:
 *
 *  -# Register a callback function using \a ch_io_complete_callback_set().
 *  -# Define and initialize a handler for the DMA interrupts generated.
 *  -# Synchronize with all sensors whose I/Q data should be read by waiting for all to indicate
 *     data ready.
 *  -# Set up a non-blocking read on each sensor, using \a ch_get_iq_data() with \a mode =
 *     \a CH_IO_MODE_NONBLOCK (1).
 *  -# Start the non-blocking reads on all sensors in the group, using \a ch_io_start_nb().
 *  -# Your callback function (set in step #1 above) will be called as each individual sensor's
 *     read completes.  Your callback function should initiate any further processing of the I/Q
 *     data, possibly by setting a flag that will be checked from within the application's main
 *     execution loop.  The callback function will likely be called at interrupt level, so the
 *     amount of processing within it should be kept to a minimum.
 *
 * For a CH101 sensor, up to 150 samples are taken during each measurement cycle; for a CH201
 * sensor, up to 450 samples are taken.  So, a complete CH101 I/Q trace will contain up to 600
 * bytes of data (150 samples x 4 bytes per sample), and a CH201 I/Q trace may contain up to
 * 1800 bytes.  The buffer specified by \a buf_ptr must be large enough to hold this amount of data.
 *
 * When the I/Q data is read from the sensor, the additional time required to transfer the I/Q
 * data over the SPI/I2C bus must be taken into account when planning how often the sensor can be

 *
 * \return 0 if success, 1 if error
 *
 * This function configures the filtering of data ready interrupts from the
 * sensor based on target detection.
 *
 * In normal operation (if target detection interrupt filtering is not enabled), the sensor
 * will assert the INT line at the end of each measurement even if no target is detected.
 * This is the default behavior if this function is not used, or if \a tgt_int_filter is
 * CH_TGT_INT_FILTER_OFF.
 *
 * When basic target interrupt filtering is enabled, the sensor will assert the INT
 * line at the end of each measurement only if a target object was detected.  If no target
 * is detected, the sensor will not interrupt, and there is no indication from the sensor
 * that the measurement has completed.
 *
 * To use basic target interrupt filtering, set \a tgt_int_filter to \a CH_TGT_INT_FILTER_ANY.
 *
 * Target counter mode provides another level of filtering, across multiple measurements.
 * When counter filtering is enabled, the sensor will only interrupt after multiple measurements
 * have detected a target within a certain total number of consecutive recent measurements.
 * A configurable history of previous measurements is recorded, and the results are compared against a
 * threshold number of target detections.  The sensor will generate an interrupt only when
 * the count of target detections within the set of recent measurements meets the threshold value,
 *
 * To use counter mode filtering, set \a tgt_int_filter to \a CH_TGT_INT_FILTER_COUNTER.
 * The measurement history and target detection threshold count used in the filter can be
 * set by using the \a ch_set_target_int_counter() function.
 *
 * If not otherwise specified, the default measurement history length is 5 measurements.
 * The current measurement is combined with the measurements from the history, so a total of 6
 * measurements are used.  The default interrupt threshold is 3 target detections.  So by
 * default, 3 of the 6 most recent measurements must detect a target to generate an interrupt.
 *
 * By default, the counter filter maintains its history and counter values after an interrupt
 * is generated, so the next measurement may again interrupt based on the threshold comparison
 * as usual.  The counter filter may instead be configured to reset after generating an interrupt
 * by using \a ch_set_target_int_counter().  In this case, the full \a thresh_count threshold
 * must be met based on new detections, so that minimum number of measurements must occur

 *
 * \return 0 if success, 1 if error
 *
 * This function changes the default real-time clock (RTC) configuration to
 * meet special requirements and system limitations.  In most applications,
 * this function is not needed and should not be called.
 *
 * Two options may be set.  For the internal RTC clock, this function can specify
 * alternatives to the standard clock calibration.  Or, this function can
 * indicate that an external clock source be used to drive the sensor's RTC
 * functions.
 *
 * An accurate measurement of the sensor's RTC clock is an important part of the
 * time-of-flight calculations performed by the ultrasonic sensor and SonicLib.
 * Any inaccuracy in the RTC frequency value will directly result in inaccuracy
 * in time-of-flight, and therefore range, measurements.
 *
 * ### Internal RTC Calibration
 * Normally, the sensor's internal RTC clock frequency is measured during sensor
 * initialization, using an external timed pulse (typically 100 ms) on the sensor
 * INT line.  This pulse takes place during \a ch_group_start().  Using a timed
 * calibration pulse is recommended, because it gives the best overall sensor accuracy.
 * In some situations, however, it may be impossible or inconvenient to apply a
 * sufficiently accurate timed pulse to calibrate the RTC.  This function provides
 * two alternative ways to set the frequency value, with some sacrifice in ultimate
 * sensor accuracy.
 *
 * This function can specify the frequency, in Hz, for the RTC using either the stored
 * factory test result or a custom value.  This function does not actually change the
 * sensor's internal RTC frequency, it simply sets the numeric value that will be used
 * in calculations where the RTC frequency is needed.
 *
 * #### Using the Factory RTC Calibration
 * ICU sensors contain factory test data that includes a measurement of the sensor's
 * internal RTC frequency.  This value provides a reasonable substitute for performing
 * full calibration using a calibration pulse.
 *
 * To use the factory RTC calibration data, specify \a CH_RTC_SRC_INTERNAL for
 * \a rtc_source and a value of zero for \a rtc_freq.
 *
 * Factory RTC calibration values are not available for CH101 or CH201 sensors.
 *
 * #### Using the I/O Bus Clock to Estimate RTC Frequency
 * In some cases, it is possible to use the I/O bus clock as a reference for calibrating
 * the RTC.  (This feature is only available in select sensor f/w variants.)
 *
 * To use the bus clock for calibration, specify \a CH_RTC_SRC_INTERNAL for
 * \a rtc_source, and set \a rtc_freq to \a CH_RTC_USE_BUS_SPEED.
 *
 * For CH101/CH201 sensor types that support this calibration mode, the I2C bus
 * clock (SCL) speed is assumed to be 400000 Hz by default.  If a different, more
 * accurate value for the bus clock speed is available, it can be specified
 * by defining \a CHIRP_I2C_BUS_SPEED_HZ in the \b chirp_board_config.h file in the
 * board support package, and setting the value to the correct bus speed.  Inaccuracies
 * in the bus clock rate value will affect frequency and range measurements by the sensor.
 *
 * #### Supplying an Estimated RTC Frequency
 * If \a rtc_freq is not zero or CH_RTC_USE_BUS_SPEED, the specified value will be
 * used in all calculations requiring the RTC frequency.  Normal calibration using a
 * pulse is not performed.  The \a rtc_freq value should be the best available
 * estimate of the RTC frequency for this device.
 *
 * To use an estimated RTC frequency, specify \a CH_RTC_SRC_INTERNAL for
 * \a rtc_source, and set \a rtc_freq to the approximate RTC frequency, in Hz.
 *
 * If no other estimate is available, \a rtc_freq may be specified as \a CH_RTC_FREQ_TYPICAL
 * (29000 Hz) for a rough approximation of a typical RTC frequency.
 *
 * This option is a last choice, due to the impact on measurement accuracy, but it will
 * allow measurements to be completed.
 *
 * ### Using an External RTC Clock
 * This function can also set the source of the sensor's real-time clock.  By default,
 * the sensor will use its internal oscillator as the RTC clock time base.  To use the
 * internal RTC, no special action is required, and this routine does not have to be called
 * unless you are changing the calibration values described above.
 *
 * For enhanced timing accuracy, an external clock source (e.g. crystal oscillator) may be
 * connected to the ICU sensor.  This may be used to maintain a more exact measurement interval
 * for sensors operating in free-running mode (CH_MODE_FREERUN).
 *
 * To enable an external clock source for the RTC, set \a rtc_source to \a CH_RTC_SRC_EXTERNAL,
 * and set \a rtc_freq to the frequency of the clock signal in Hz (e.g. 32768 for a
 * 32.768 kHz crystal).
 *
 * ### When to Call this Function
 * This function should be called after \a ch_init() but before \a ch_group_start().
 * This function must be called before \a ch_group_start(), because RTC calibration is
 * normally done then.  When this function is used, the sensor will not require or perform
 * automatic RTC calibration using a timed pulse.
 *
 * All sensors in a sensor group must use the same calibration method, automatic (default)
 * or manual (using this routine for each sensor in the group before \a ch_group_start()).
 *
 * \note This function may only be called during sensor initialization, after \a ch_init()
 * and before \a ch_group_start().  Use at any other time will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * See also \a ch_get_rtc_frequency().

 *
 * \return 0 if success, 1 if error
 *
 * This function configures the PMUT clock input and output settings to allow
 * the multiple sensors to share a common clock signal.  One sensor may be
 * set to output the signal from the PMUT clock, while others may be set
 * to use that signal as a clock input.  This permits very exact frequency
 * matching for critical applications.  Alternatively, all sensors may
 * be set to use an independent, external clock signal.
 *
 * This function may only be called after \a ch_group_start() has initialized
 * the sensors.  The original PMUT clock settings will be modified,
 * and the new settings will be applied immediately.  The PMUT clock settings
 * must be set separately for each sensor.
 *
 * - Normally, the PMUT clock is internal and the signal is not output on the
 * sensor MUTCLK pad.  This function is not needed in this case.  (This is the
 * default CH_PMUT_CLK_DEFAULT configuration.)
 *
 * - To enable output of the sensor's PMUT clock on the MUTCLK pad, set \a clock_cfg
 * to CH_PMUT_CLK_OUTPUT_AUTO or CH_PMUT_CLK_OUTPUT_ENABLE. The AUTO setting allows
 * the ICU part to control the power state of the clock. In this case, the clock
 * will only be available while the ICU part is actively performing a measurement.
 * This is a good option to use when multiple parts will be active simultaneously.
 * The ENABLE option will unconditionally force the clock on. This can be used
 * in situations where the clock should be available even if the part providing it
 * is inactive, such as during transmit optimization.
 *
 * - The output frequency of the signal on the pad will be 16 times the sensor's
 * acoustic operating frequency.
 *
 * - To use an input signal on the MUTCLK pad as the external PMUT clock source,
 * set \a clock_cfg to CH_PMUT_CLK_SRC_EXTERNAL.  In this configuration, the
 * sensor's PMUT will operate at 1/16 the input clock signal frequency.
 *
 * - To restore the default PMUT clock configuration (i.e. to un-do either operation),
 * set \a clock_cfg to CH_PMUT_CLK_DEFAULT.
 *
 * When one sensor supplies the clock for one or more other sensors, the sequence of
 * enabling and disabling the clock settings across the sensors is important.
 * The clock source must be present whenever a secondary sensor is
 * configured to use an external clock source.
 * - When enabling, the clock source sensor should be set to CH_PMUT_CLK_OUTPUT_AUTO or
 *   CH_PMUT_CLK_OUTPUT_ENABLE first, then the other sensor(s) should
 *   be set to CH_PMUT_CLK_SRC_EXTERNAL.
 * - When disabling, the secondary sensor(s) should be set to CH_PMUT_CLK_DEFAULT
 *   first, then the clock source sensor should be set to CH_PMUT_CLK_DEFAULT.
 *
 * If an independent clock source (not from a sensor) is used, that input signal
 * must be present and \a ch_group_set_pmut_clock_freq() must be called to specify the clock
 * frequency before the sensors are set to CH_PMU_CLK_SRC_EXTERNAL.
 *
 * The \a ch_get_frequency() function will report the current acoustic operating
 * frequency of the PMUT, regardless of the clock source.  So, if the sensor is using an
 * external clock source, the indicated frequency will match that of the sensor supplying
 * the clock signal, or 1/16 the input clock rate if an independent signal.
 *
 * Only one shared PMUT clock signal can be used within a sensor group.  Individual
 * sensors are not required to use the shared clock.
