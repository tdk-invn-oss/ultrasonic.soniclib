 *
 * \brief User-supplied board support package functions to interface Chirp SonicLib to a specific
 * hardware platform.
 *
 * This file defines the I/O interfaces that allow the standard Chirp SonicLib sensor driver
 * functions to manage one or more sensors on a specific hardware platform.  These include
 * functions to initialize and control the various I/O pins connecting the sensor to the host
 * system, the SPI or I2C communications interface, timer functions, etc.
 *
 * Typically, most of the functions in the BSP are implemented as "wrapper functions" for
 * operations that are provided in the MCU vendor's I/O library.  So, the BSP largely
 * serves as a translation layer for most functions.
 *
 * The board support package developer should not need to modify this header file.  However,
 * that developer is responsible for implementing these support functions for the hardware
 * platform, using the interfaces defined here.  Note that some functions are optional, depending
 * on the specific runtime requirements (e.g. is non-blocking I/O required?) or development needs
 * (e.g. is debugging support needed?).
 *
 * \note All functions are marked as REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, or OPTIONAL in their indvidual
 * descriptions.  "Recommended" functions are either not used directly by SonicLib (but may be
 * expected by examples and other applications from Chirp) or are only required to support certain
 * operating configurations (e.g. individual device triggering).
 *
 * \note Some BSP functions are only used with a specific generation of Chirp Sensor, either the
 * ICU family or the earlier CH101 & CH201 devices.  The description of these functions will
 * indicate which sensors are applicable.  If not specified, the requirement applies equally
 * to ICU and CH101/CH201 sensors.
 *
 *	### Organization
 *	The file organization for a BSP is intentionally very flexible, so that you may efficiently
 *	use existing code that supports your hardware or otherwise use your own organizing
 *	preferences.
 *
 *	Typically, the required BSP functions are placed in a file called chbsp_NNNN.c, where
 *	NNNN is the board name.  For example, in the Chirp BSP for the Nucleo144 development
 *	board the main file is called chbsp_nucleo144.c, and in the BSP for the Chirp SmartSonic
 *	evaluation, it is called chbsp_chirp_smartsonic.c.
 *
 *	### Sensor Interrupt Handling
 *
 *	In addition to providing the required \a chbsp_xxx() functions as described above, the BSP
 *	must also provide a routine to handle interrupts from the sensor.  Because the handler
 *	routine is not referenced by SonicLib, it can have any name that fits your conventions.
 *
 *	All Chirp sensors use a level change on an interrupt line to indicate the completion of a
 *	measurement (data ready).
 *
 *	ICU family sensors have two different lines that may be used as the interrupt indicator,
 *	INT1 and INT2.  Interrupt and trigger lines for ICU sensors are high when inactive, so the
 *	interrupt is indicated by a transition to a low level.
 *
 *	ICU sensors may be configured for either pulse mode or latching mode by calling the
 *	\a ch_set_interrupt_mode() function from the application.  In pulse mode, the sensor will
 *	indicate an interrupt by briefly (~800ns) bringing the line low then returning it to a high
 *	level.  In latching mode, the sensor will bring the line low and the interrupt handler in the BSP is
 *	responsible for resetting the line to a high (inactive) level.  By default, ICU sensors
 *	use latching mode.
 *
 *	ICU sensors also use the interrupt line for various other events in addition to data ready.
 *	The interrupt type will be passed to the application's callback routine when an interrupt
 *	occurs.
 *
 *	CH101 and CH201 sensors have a single interrupt line that is normally used only for data
 *	ready interrupts.  The line is low when inactive, so the interrupt consists of a brief
 *	high pulse.  CH101/CH201 sensors always use "INT1" routines and interfaces.
 *
 *	#### Notifying SonicLib that a Sensor Interrupt Occurred
 *
 *	The BSP's handler routine that detects that a sensor interrupt has occurred
 *	(typically to indicate completion of a measurement) must notify SonicLib by
 *	calling \a ch_interrupt().  The \a ch_interrupt() function takes two
 *	parameters, a pointer to the ch_group_t descriptor for the group containing
 *	the interrupting sensor, and the device number within the group.
 *
 *	The sensor will be examined by SonicLib to determine the interrupt type.
 *	Then, the application's callback routine that was registered using
 *	\a ch_io_int_callback_set() will be called to notify the application.
 *	The interrupt type will be passed to the appliction callback routine.
 *
 *	All this processing takes place in the context of the BSP interrupt handler.
 *
 *	### Non-blocking I/O Notification
 *
 *	If non-blocking I/O is used, the BSP's handler functions which processes the
 *	completion of an I/O operation must notify SonicLib that the I/O has completed by
 *	calling the \a ch_io_notify() function.  The group pointer and SPI/I2C bus number must
 *	be passed as parameters to identify which I/O channel has finished.
 *
 *	### Required \b chirp_board_config.h Header File
 *
 *	The board support package must supply a header file called \b chirp_board_config.h containing
 *	definitions of two symbols used in the SonicLib driver functions.
 *
 *	The \b chirp_board_config.h file must be in the C pre-processor include path when you build
 *	your application with SonicLib.
 *
 *	The following symbols must be defined in \b chirp_board_config.h:
 *	- \a CHIRP_MAX_NUM_SENSORS	= maximum number of Chirp sensors
 *	- \a CHIRP_NUM_BUSES	    = number of SPI/I2C bus interfaces
 *
 * #### Special Symbols
 * The following symbols are optional and normally not required.  If defined,
 * they allow special handling in SonicLib for certain hardware configurations
 * or limitations.
 *
 * - \a  MAX_PROG_XFER_SIZE	 	= maximum SPI/I2C transfer size when programming sensor
 *
 *  The sensor is programmed during the \a ch_group_start() function.  Normally,
 * the entire sensor firmware image (6144 bytes for ICU sensors, or 2048 bytes for
 * CH101/CH201 sensors)) is written in a single SPI or I2C write operation. For hardware
 * platforms that cannot support such a large transfer, the MAX_PROG_XFER_SIZE symbol can be
 * defined to specify the maximum size, in bytes, for a single transfer.  The sensor programming
 * will be divided into multiple transfers as necessary.
 *
 *  For example, to limit the maximum transfer size to 256 bytes, add the following
 * line in your \b chirp_board_config.h file:
 *
 * 		#define	MAX_PROG_XFER_SIZE	256
 *
 * - \a  USE_STD_I2C_FOR_IQ		= disable optimized low-level I/Q data readout (CH101/CH201)
 *
 *  This optional symbol is only used with CH101 and CH201 sensors (it has no effect with
 * ICU sensors).  When this symbol is defined, SonicLib will use standard I2C addressing to
 * read I/Q data from the sensor.  Otherwise, an optimized low-level interface
 * is used, with improved performance.
 *
 *
 *	### Implementation Hints
 *
 * Most of the required functions take a pointer to a ch_dev_t device descriptor structure as
 * a handle to identify the sensor being controlled.  The ch_dev_t structure contains various
 * fields with configuration and operating state information for the device.  In general, these
 * values may be obtained using various \a ch_get_XXX() functions provided by the
 * SonicLib API, so it should not be necessary to access fields directly.
 *
 * Some functions take a pointer to a ch_group_t (sensor group descriptor) structure as a parameter
 * but must operate on individual sensors.  These functions can be implemented using the
 * \a ch_get_dev_ptr() function to access the ch_dev_t structure describing each individual sensor
 * in the group, based on its device number (I/O index value).  The total number of possible
 * sensor devices in a group may be obtained by using the \a ch_get_num_ports() function.
 *
 * Similarly, each sensor's ch_dev_t structure contains a \a dev_num field that may be used to
 * manage the pin assignments for the various sensors, by using it as an index into individual
 * arrays which list the pins assigned to the PROG, INT, and RESET_N lines.  The \a dev_num value
 * for a sensor may be obtained using the \a ch_get_dev_num() function.
 *
 * Often, an action should only be taken on a sensor port if a sensor is present and has been
 * successfully initialized and connected.  The \a ch_sensor_is_connected() function can be
 * used to obtain the connection status.
 *
 * These functions are often used together to implement a board support routine, as in the
 * following pseudo-code which shows how to perform an action on all connected devices in a
 * group.  This snippet assumes that a sensor group pointer (ch_group_t *) called \a grp_ptr is
 * an input parameter to the function:
 *
 *		ch_dev_t *dev_ptr;
 *		uint8_t   dev_num;
 *
 *		for (dev_num = 0; dev_num < ch_get_num_ports(grp_ptr); dev_num++ {
 *
 *			dev_ptr = ch_get_dev_ptr(grp_ptr, dev_num);
 *
 *			if (ch_sensor_is_connected(dev_ptr)) {
 *
 *				 DO WHAT NEEDS DOING FOR THIS CONNECTED DEVICE
 *			}
 *		}
 *
 *	The \a dev_num value for each device is specified by the user application as a parameter to
 *	\a ch_init().
 *
 *
 *	\note Example board support packages that implement the chirp_bsp.h functions are available
 *	from Chirp Microsystems for specific platforms.  Contact Chirp for more information.

/*!
 * \brief Main hardware initialization
 *
 * This function executes the required hardware initialization sequence for the board being used.
 * This includes clock, memory, and processor setup as well as any special handling that is needed.
 * This function is called at the beginning of an application, as the first operation.
 *
 * Along with the actual hardware initialization, this function must also initialize the following
 * fields within the ch_group_t sensor group descriptor:
 *  - \b num_ports = number of sensor ports (possible connections) on the board.  This is usually the
 *  same as \a CHIRP_MAX_DEVICES in \b chirp_board_config.h.
 *  - \b num_buses = number of I/O buses on the board, usually the same as \a CHIRP_NUM_BUSES
 *  in \b chirp_board_config.h.
 *  - \b rtc_cal_pulse_ms = length (duration) of the "pulse" sent on the INT line to each sensor
 *  during calibration of the real-time clock.  For ICU sensors, there are actually two low
 *  pulses, separated by this interval.  For CH101/CH201 sensors, there is a single high pulse
 *  with this duration.  A typical value of this field is \b 100ms, but it can be adjusted to
 *  suit your system contraints.
 *
 *	#### Discovering If a Sensor Is Present
 * Often, during initialization the BSP needs to determine which sensor ports (possible
 * connections) actually have a sensor attached. Here is a short sequence you can use to
 * confirm if a Chirp sensor is alive and communicating by reading two signature byte
 * values from the device using SPI/I2C.
 *
 * ##### ICU Sensors
 * ICU sensors (based on the Shasta architecture) contain a multi-byte "CPU ID" value that may be
 * read over SPI.  The two most signficant bytes will always contain a standard value that can
 * be read to confirm that an ICU sensor is present.
 *
 * - Using SPI, read two bytes from debug register \a SHASTA_DBG_REG_CPU_ID_HI (0x0001):
 *
 *			uint16_t command = (SPI_CMD_DBG_REG_READ | SHASTA_DBG_REG_CPU_ID_HI);
 *			uint8_t  cmd_buf[3];
 *
 *			cmd_buf[0] = (command & 0x00FF);			// LSB
 *			cmd_buf[1] = ((command & 0xFF00) >> 8);		// MSB
 *			cmd_buf[2] = 0;								// required dummy byte
 *
 *			// *** Assert SPI chip select for device
 *
 *			// *** Write 3 cmd_buf bytes to device via spi
 *
 *			// *** Read 2 bytes from device
 *
 *			// *** De-assert SPI chip select for device
 *
 * - If an ICU sensor is present, the read value will be \a SHASTA_CPU_ID_HI_VALUE (0x2041).


 *
 * ##### CH101 & CH201 Sensors
 * This sequence applies to CH101 and CH201 devices using an I2C interface.
 *
 * A couple key points:
 * - The initial I2C address for all CH101 and CH201 sensors is \a CH_I2C_ADDR_PROG (0x45).
 *   This address is used during initialization and programming.  Once the device is programmed,
 *   a different I2C address is assigned for normal operation.
 * - A device will only respond to this programming address (0x45) if its PROG line is asserted
 *   (active high).
 *
 * So, the overall sequence should be:
 *  -# Power on board and device, initialize I2C bus.
 *  -# Assert the PROG line for the sensor port to be tested (active high).
 *  -# Perform a two-byte I2C register read from the device from this location:
 *  	- I2C address = \a CH_I2C_ADDR_PROG (0x45)
 *  	- Register address/offset = 0x00
 *  -# Check the byte values that were read from the device.  If a Chirp sensor is present, the
 *  returned bytes should be:
 *		- \a CH_SIG_BYTE_0	(hex value \b 0x0A)
 *		- \a CH_SIG_BYTE_1	(hex value \b 0x02)
 *  -# De-assert the PROG line for the sensor port.
 *
 * This function is REQUIRED.

 *
 * This function should read the specified number of bytes from an I2C slave device, using
 * an internal memory or register address.  The remote device will return \a num_bytes bytes
 * starting at internal memory/register address \a mem_addr.
 *
 * The I2C interface must have already been initialized using \a chbsp_i2c_init().
 *
 * There are two distinct phases to the transfer.  First, the register address must be written
 * to the sensor, then a read operation must be done to obtain the data.  (Note that the byte
 * count does not have to be sent to the device during a read operation, unlike in \a chbsp_i2c_mem_write()).)
 *
 * The preferred way to do this is with a *repeated-start operation*, in which the write phase is
 * followed by another I2C Start condition (rather than a Stop) and then the read operation begins
 * immediately.  This prevents another device on the bus from getting control between the write and
 * read phases.  Many micro-controller I/O libraries include dedicated I2C functions to perform just
 * such an operation for writing registers.
 *
 * When using the repeated start, the overall sequence looks like this:
 *
 * |                         Write phase  ||    \|           |                   Read Phase                            ||||||   \|
 * :-----------: | :------:  | :------:    | :------------:  | :-----------------:  | :------:  | :-------:     | :------:      | :-------: | :---:
 * **I2C START** | I2C Addr  | \a mem_addr | \b I2C \b START | I2C Addr + read bit  |  *\a data | *(\a data + 1)| *(\a data + 2)| etc...    | \b I2C \b STOP
 *
 * If the repeated-start technique is not used, it is possible to read from the sensor using separate,
 * sequential I2C write and read operations.  In this case, the sequence is much the same, except that
 * the write phase is ended by an I2C Stop condition, then an I2C Start is issued to begin the read phase.
 * However, this may be a problem if more than one bus master is present,
 * because the bus is not held between the two phases.
 *
